        <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>

<div class="bod"></div><strong>Who We Are</strong><br>
We are a team of three passionate Electrical Engineering students from the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET), driven by the goal of using technology to solve real-world problems. Though our academic background is in electrical engineering, our shared interest in software development and healthcare innovation led us to create Fourth Trimesterâ€”a platform dedicated to supporting new mothers through pregnancy and postpartum care.<br><br>

<strong>Mission</strong><br>
Pregnancy and postpartum recovery come with physical, emotional, and mental challenges. Many new mothers struggle with a lack of proper guidance, medical advice, and emotional support during this crucial period. Fourth Trimester was born out of a desire to bridge this gap by providing reliable information, expert-backed resources, and a supportive community for mothers navigating this journey.<br><br>

<strong>What We Offer</strong><br>
Comprehensive Guidance: Medical insights, self-care tips, and expert articles on postpartum recovery, mental health, nutrition, and infant care.
Community Support: A safe space for mothers to connect, share experiences, and seek advice from professionals.
Personalized Assistance: AI-powered recommendations tailored to a motherâ€™s specific needs, helping her find the right resources at the right time.
Our Vision
We believe that every mother deserves a stress-free postpartum experience with the right support at her fingertips. Through Fourth Trimester, we aim to create an accessible and trusted digital companion for new mothersâ€”helping them embrace this phase with confidence and care.<br><br>
